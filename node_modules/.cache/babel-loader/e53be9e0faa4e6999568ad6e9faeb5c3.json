In order to understand the difference between average \n                    and marginal emissions of the electricity system, understanding today’s competitive energy wholesale market is required.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Up until 20 years ago, a single utility was responsible to dial-up and down its daily energy supply for a specific area\n                     depending on the demand. It would own the power plant (power source) and all the transmission lines that are necessary \n                     to supply power. However, in today’s energy market, all the resources are shared and administered by organizations like CAISO.\n                      The market does a short-term demand forecast a day ahead to bring in enough suppliers to come online and place bids (Liastgarten, 2019). \n                      As seen in figure below, all the power plants are brought in order of price and every five minutes throughout the day, the market decides \n                      which plant to run, to match the supply.\n                </p>\n                <figure>\n                    <div>\n                        <img className=\"big_image\" src='https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/img/how-prices-are-set-2018-01.jpg' alt=\"Figure 3\"/>\n                    </div>\n                </figure>\n\n                <h2>Average Emissions &amp; Marginal Emissions</h2>\n                <p>\n                    <strong>Average emissions</strong> are calculated across all generators by using the total carbon emission and total amount of electricity generated.  \n                    Referring back to the supply stack above, the average emissions would be the average of plant A, B, C, and part of D. Google uses average emission \n                    for <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-clean-is-cloud-computing-new-data-reveals-how-green-googles-data-centers-really-are/\">CFE%</a> calculations. \n                    This value can indicate which regions are performing at optimal levels for lessening their carbon impacts and which regions need significant improvement \n                    in renewable energy systems. In addition, the CFE% allows Google to inform its customers about optimal locations to provide services across their cloud \n                    infrastructure. Other than costs and data latency, carbon emissions are also important when determining the location to run an application. \n                    For example, in the state of Oregon, the calculated CFE% is 89%, which means that on average, the data centers in Oregon run on carbon free energy \n                    about 89% of the time.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    <strong>Marginal emissions</strong> are calculated  based on the relationship between decision and consequence. \n                    (Corradi, 2019) “The marginal emissions are the emissions that would come online if new loads were added.”( Listgarten, 2019). \n                    According to the supply stack above, the marginal emissions are from plant D. Due to its predictive nature of carbon intensity \n                    on the grid, it’s more accurate for loadshiting, scheduling and optimizing a flexible load with a cleaner energy. According to \n                    <a href=\"https://gridbeyond.com/load-shifting-low-down-guide/\">GridBeyond</a>, <strong>load shifting</strong> essentially means \n                    moving electricity consumption or electric loads from one time period or region to another.\n                </p>\n\n                <h2>Marginal Emissions for Load shifting</h2>\n                <p>\n                    Compared to average emissions, marginal emissions are more accurate for optimizing and scheduling load shifting to help reduce our\n                    emissions. To explain loadshifting, assume that there are three different power plants on the grid as shown below - solar (10MW capacity) , \n                    efficient gas (10MW capacity) and inefficient gas (4MW capacity). Solar plant A has zero carbon emissions, coal gas plant B has medium emissions, \n                    and coal gas plant C has high emissions.\n                </p>\n\n                <figure>\n                    <div>\n                        <img className=\"image\" src='https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/photos/44/3354.jpg' alt=\"Figure 2\" />\n                        <figcaption><em>Source: <a href= \"https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2019/09/29/marginal-emissions-what-they-are-and-when-to-use-them\">Palo Alto</a></em></figcaption>\n                    </div>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    These three power plants run to meet the demand of 5 MW at 1 AM and 21 MW at 4 PM. The average emissions will be lower at 4 PM since \n                    average emission is calculated across all power plants and the solar plant A will bring down the average emissions. However, \n                    the marginal emissions are lower at 1 AM. Therefore, if a flexible load is to be scheduled to help reduce the emissions, marginal \n                    emissions should be used and scheduled for 1 AM. Doing this will make the requirements to be met by the efficient gas plant \n                    B that has medium emissions instead of inefficient gas with high CO2. \n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    When considering how a hyer-scale computing should geographically shift their computing load to reduce CO2 emissions from electric \n                    power generation, studies have found that shifting based on the marginal emissions achieves a significant reduction in CO2 and \n                    outperforms shifting based on average emissions. (Lindberg et al., 2020). Figure below shows the result of Google’s tests on load-shifting \n                    at data centers with its new carbon-intelligence computing platform based on marginal emissions. \n                </p>\n\n                <figure>\n                    <div>\n                        <img className=\"image\" src='https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/BINK_carbonaware_linegraph_1.max-600x600.jpg' />\n                        <figcaption><em>Source: <a href= \"https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/data-centers-work-harder-sun-shines-wind-blows\">Google </a></em></figcaption>\n                    </div>\n                </figure>\n\n                <h2>Limitation of Marginal Emissions</h2>\n                <p>\n                    However, unlike average emissions, marginal emissions are not easily available and extremely volatile. \n                    A good example can be the one given by Listgarten (2019).\n                </p>\n                <img className=\"big_image\" alt=\"this is Alt Text\" src=\"https://github.com/ThetNoe/PicForMarkDown/blob/main/Supply.png?raw=true\" />\n                <figcaption><em>Source: <a href= \"https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/data-centers-work-harder-sun-shines-wind-blows\">CAISO </a> </em></figcaption>\n\n                <p>\n                    The graph above shows the energy supply on May 3rd, 2019. At 1:27 PM on that day, the average emissions were 284 lbs/MWh and \n                    marginal emissions were 1012lbs/MWh. There is a considerable amount of difference between average and marginal emission. \n                    This was caused by a sudden drop in solar and rise of natural gas at 1:27PM. At around 1:50PM, the solar came back up and marginal \n                    emissions dropped again. Even within a 30-minute time frame, marginal emissions are hard to predict and volatile.Just like many other \n                    companies today, which are committed to move toward a sustainable future and greener energy, Microsoft and its Carbon ‘Carbon Negative \n                    by 2030’ plan principles are invested in science, technology and accurate math to reduce and remove the company’s historical carbon emissions. \n                    Today, thanks to many new technological solutions and accurate metrics, we can accurately measure carbon emissions to better strategize our \n                    emission reduction efforts. For example, companies can now utilize advanced technological tools like WattTime’s Automated Emission Reduction \n                    (AER) technology to lower the emission by automatically scheduling their load with cleaner energy and avoid dirtier energy without compromising \n                    performance and cost.\n                </p>      \n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default KbSummary; "]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
